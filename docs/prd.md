## Original Requirements:
Build an artificial intelligence application built on the concept of object detection. Analyze basketball shots by digging into the data collected from object detection. We can get the result by simply uploading files to the web App or submitting a POST request to the API.

## Product Goals:
- Create an AI application that uses object detection to analyze basketball shots.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for uploading files or submitting POST requests to get the analysis results.
- Deliver accurate and insightful data analysis for basketball shots.

## User Stories:
- As a basketball coach, I want to upload videos of basketball shots to the application and receive detailed analysis of the shots, including accuracy, angle, and trajectory.
- As a basketball player, I want to submit a POST request with the necessary shot data to the API and receive real-time feedback on the quality of my shots.
- As a basketball analyst, I want to use the application to analyze large datasets of basketball shots and identify patterns and trends in shooting performance.
- As a basketball fan, I want to use the application to analyze professional basketball games and gain insights into the shooting performance of players and teams.
- As a developer, I want to integrate the application's API into my own basketball-related applications to provide shot analysis functionality to my users.
